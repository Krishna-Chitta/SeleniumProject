# ðŸ“Œ Portfolio Overview  

This portfolio consists of **three main parts**, each focusing on a different aspect of test automation:  

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Selenium with Python  
- I will create **individual Python files** for practicing Selenium concepts.  
- Each file will be **clearly named**, so you can easily understand what topics are covered.  

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Pytest  
- Follows a **similar structure** to the Selenium section.  
- I'll try to make sure that each concept will have a **dedicated file** for better organization and learning.  

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Jenkins Integration  
- The **final step**â€”bringing everything together with Jenkins!  
- Excited to integrate it and automate the entire workflow. *Fingers crossed!* ðŸ¤ž

## ðŸ’¡ Additional Notes  
- Iâ€™ll add **comments** in the code to make it easier to follow.  
- The goal is to make this **beginner-friendly** while keeping it useful for anyone exploring test automation.

## ðŸŽ“ Credits  

- I am learning **Selenium with Python** from YouTube channel: **Testing Funda by Zeeshan Asghar**.  
- **Jenkins** from **Rahul Shettyâ€™s course on Udemy**.  
- **Pytest** from a mix of the above two courses.  
- I learnt **Python** from **Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python** on Udemy. *(Python concepts are not covered in this project, but I learnt enough to do testing + learnt Turtle graphics, which was fun.)*
