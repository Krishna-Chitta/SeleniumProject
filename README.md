The portfolio has three parts. 

First would be Selenium with python where I would create individual python files for practicing selenium concepts.
•	  You could clearly see the python file name and understand what topics would be covered in those.

Second would be pytest where I follow a similar pattern and try to make individual files per concept

Third would be the beautiful Jenkins integration! Fingers crossed! Can't wait to finish this project!

I'll try to include comments for readers to understand the code better.

Credits: 
•	  I am learning selenium with python from youtube channel: Testing Funda by Zeeshan Asghar.
•	  Jenkins from Rahul Shetty course on Udemy.
•	  Pytest from mix of the above two courses.
•	  I learnt Python from Angela Yu's 100 days of Python from Udemy(Python concepts are not covered in this project). Learnt enough to do testing + learnt Turtle graphics which was fun.


Finally, Thanks for reading! Hope you could also use this project to learn Selenium. Have a great day!
